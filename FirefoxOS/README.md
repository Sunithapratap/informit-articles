# Running the Demo App

## Obtain an API key

The weather app uses Wunderground.com for weather data. Navigate to
http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/ to sign up for a API key.

Add it to the _getWeather_ function of app.js.

You should now be able to test the application on a desktop machine by
going navigating to localhost/app.html.

## Testing on an Android device or in the Firefox OS Simulator

Start a local webserver that can serve you application on port 8008.
Port 8008 is a requirement of the Firefox OS Simulator. If you are
serving the application to an actual device, it can be served from any
port you choose.

## Changing weather location

Click the gear in the upper right corner and enter the city and 2-letter
state abbreviation if
the location is in the United States. Otherwise enter the full country
name in the second text field. 

## Installing the app

Navigate to localhost:8008/ on your Android device or in the simulator.
